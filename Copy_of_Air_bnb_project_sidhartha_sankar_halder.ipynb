        "Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding - of customers' and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more. This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values. Here we explore and clean our data by removing the null values and find the proper conclusion so that company and host both will get the benefits in their business."

Additionally, it has allowed people to generate extra income by renting out their houses to residents. Nevertheless, if a prospective host's goal is to sell the property on Airbnb and make rental revenue, how can he decide which property to invest in? In addition, how does a traveller know what to look for when looking for the cheapest listing with the desired qualities? The price of a listing is influenced by a number of factors, including the location of the resident and the quality of the listing."
